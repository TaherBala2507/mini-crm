## API Integration

All components use the `leadsApi` service:
- `getLeads(filters)` - Fetch paginated leads with filters
- `getLead(id)` - Fetch single lead details
- `createLead(data)` - Create new lead
- `updateLead(id, data)` - Update existing lead
- `deleteLead(id)` - Delete lead
- `assignLead(id, userId)` - Assign lead to user (available but not yet used in UI)

## Type Safety

All components use TypeScript with proper types:
- `Lead` - Lead entity interface
- `LeadFormData` - Form submission data
- `LeadFilters` (renamed to `LeadFiltersType` in LeadsPage) - Filter parameters
- `LeadStatus` - Status enum
- `LeadSource` - Source enum
- `User` - User entity interface

## User Experience Features

### Visual Feedback
- Color-coded status chips (NEW=info, CONTACTED=primary, QUALIFIED=secondary, PROPOSAL/NEGOTIATION=warning, WON=success, LOST=error)
- Loading spinners during async operations
- Success/Error snackbar notifications
- Empty states with helpful messages
- Hover effects on table rows

### Data Formatting
- Currency formatting with $ symbol and proper decimals
- Date formatting (e.g., "Oct 5, 2025, 2:30 PM")
- Phone and email display
- Owner avatars with initials

### Accessibility
- Tooltips on action buttons
- Proper labels on form fields
- Error messages for validation
- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA labels (via Material-UI)

## Permission System Integration

The system respects user permissions:
- Create button only shown if user has `leads:create`
- Edit button disabled/hidden if user lacks `leads:update`
- Delete button disabled/hidden if user lacks `leads:delete`
- Error messages shown when attempting unauthorized actions

## Responsive Design

All components are fully responsive:
- Mobile: Single column layout, stacked filters
- Tablet: 2-column layout
- Desktop: 3-column layout with sidebar filters

## Next Steps

### Immediate Enhancements
1. **Pipeline View** - Implement Kanban-style pipeline view with drag-and-drop
2. **Lead Assignment** - Add quick assign functionality in list view
3. **Bulk Actions** - Select multiple leads for bulk operations
4. **Export** - Export leads to CSV/Excel

### Future Features
1. **Notes System** - Integrate notes component for lead activities
2. **Attachments** - Add file attachments to leads
3. **Activity Timeline** - Show lead interaction history
4. **Email Integration** - Send emails directly from lead details
5. **Lead Scoring** - Automatic lead scoring based on criteria
6. **Conversion** - Convert lead to project/customer
